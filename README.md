# Multi-Perspective and Predictive Analysis of Forests; <br /> the Issues, Challenges and Global Trends 

This project has the purpose to answer important questions that address issues, challenges and global trends of forests. We show an overview of the global forest development, analyze trends around reforestation/deforestation, point out the causes of destruction of forests and investigate how we can tackle climate change by reforestation, in particular, how an increase in forest area can help to increase the buffer of sustainability.
